## Installation

### Package manager
You can install SmashUploaderJS using npm:

```bash

```

### CDN

For browser usage, you can use it directly from the unpkg CDN:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@smash-sdk/uploader@2.1.3/dist/SmashUploader.browser.js"></script>
```

### Generating an API Key
Before you can start using the library, you need to sign up for a <u>free trial</u> or a <u>premium plan</u> on the [Smash website](https://api.fromsmash.com/). Once you're signed up, you can create an API Key by following these steps:

1. Log in to your Smash account and navigate to the "API Keys" section in your profile menu.
2. Click on the "Create secret key" button.
3. Give your API Key a name that will help you identify it later.
4. Click the "Create" button button to generate your new API Key. Make sure to copy the API Key and keep it somewhere safe, as you won't be able to see it again once you leave this page.

## Usage

### Importing the library

```js
// Using ES6 module
import { SmashUploader } from '@smash-sdk/uploader';

// Or using CommonJS module
const { SmashUploader } = require('@smash-sdk/uploader');
