## Installation

You can install SmashUploaderJS using npm:

```
npm install @smash-sdk/uploader
```

## Usage

### Importing the library

```
// Using ES6 module
import { SmashUploader } from '@smash-sdk/uploader';

// Or using CommonJS module
const { SmashUploader } = require('@smash-sdk/uploader');
```

Alternatively, you can also use it directly from a CDN:

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@smash-sdk/uploader/dist/SmashUploader.browser.js"></script>
```


### Creating an instance

```
const uploader = new SmashUploader();
```

### Uploading a file

```
const fileInput = document.querySelector('input[type="file"]');
const file = fileInput.files[0];

uploader.upload(file, {
  onSuccess: (response) => console.log('Upload success:', response),
  onError: (error) => console.error('Upload error:', error),
});
```

### Events

SmashUploaderJS provides several events that you can listen to:

- `start`: Fired when the upload starts.
- `progress`: Fired when the upload progress is updated.
- `success`: Fired when the upload is successfully completed.
- `error`: Fired when an error occurs during the upload.
- `end`: Fired when the upload is completed, regardless of the outcome (success or error).

```
uploader.on('progress', (progress) => {
  console.log(`Upload progress: ${progress}%`);
});

uploader.on('success', (response) => {
  console.log('Upload success:', response);
});

uploader.on('error', (error) => {
  console.error('Upload error:', error);
});
```
